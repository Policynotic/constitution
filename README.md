# constitution
Describes an alternative U.S. government where the people create and vote on legislation directly, no Congress or other representation necessary. Competing versions of laws and policies are published and forked on a Github-like collaborative system for legislation. There are 9 executive departments, whose policies, regulations, budgets, and appointments are also determined by the people directly. Presidents are elected by popular vote to head each department and have very narrowly conscribed and specific powers. A flat tax is levied on total income and individuals have the power to decide where their personal tax dollars are allocated. The entire federal welfare state is eliminated and instead a basic income of an amount determined by the voters is automatically dispersed to all citizens using a cr. Voluntary voting templates can be used by less informed voters to assist them in selecting individuals and litigation that fits their views.
